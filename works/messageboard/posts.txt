Aaron:Whoops! I was trying to style my own textarea, but there was one in Materialize.css after all!
Aaron on Mobile:Testing the messageboard on mobile; everything looks good!
Aaron:Testing to see whether the form fields are correctly cleared after the post is submitted.
Aaron:That didn't work; how about now?
Aaron:Okay I think it was a caching issue. Now does it work?!
MeaI:;)
Aaron:Attempted to add a SPICY text animation.
Aaron:Forgot some quotation marks lmao. Does it work now?
Aaron:Forgot even MORE quotation marks.
Aaron:Nvm, I realised it wasn't possible due to the fact that text colour can't be animated.
Non:Oh hey MeaI
Aaron:I'll add dynamic post refreshing and timestamps too eventually.
Pellinore Winthrop:Oh how I love raspberry scones! Snap to, Will Henry!
Will Henry:Right away, sir!
Aaron:I need to put the text on the left in a .col; it gets too close to the left of the page.
Aaron:There! Change made.
Aaron:People totally lost interest in posting on my messageboard. Sad!
Aaron:Adrienne and Julio, leave a message!
Adrienne:Hellooo helloo hello! Is anybody out there?
