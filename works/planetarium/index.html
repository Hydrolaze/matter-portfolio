                        <h4>A virtual storefront for our business</h4>
                        Tim Hargrove and I worked together to create our final student choice project, a homepage for the design company we are starting soon. The intent of this website was to be a welcome mat for prospective clients, and we tried to make it interesting and easy to use. It's not complete just yet because we didn't have much time after the NCCS project, but we will be further refining it in the first weeks of Summer.

                        <h4>research, creative brief, and comp</h4>
                        We want to make sure that the Sunyhakas site will be memorable and enjoyable to use, yet familiar, so we did some research to decide how best to design our homepage.

                        <h4>Changes and refinements</h4>
                        To create a more unified theme and to simplify and improve the way the menu buttons are handled and styled, I changed my bubble buttons to "blocks". These blocks now sit at the top of the page and will hide partway off the top of the screen when the user doesn't need to see them.

                        One of the prominent features of the NCCS website is the bubble menu, which resembles the functional buttons that Google positions in the bottom right of the screen. These bubbles will animate in a variety of interesting ways according to user input.

                        <p>Based on the criticism I got from my previous design comp, I made some revisions here to make the page more usable and attractive. I also created a small branding guide to call out some of the colours and logo designs I used.</p>

                        <p>It took a while, since I have never written a creative brief before, but with the input of my team members I wrote our groups creative brief.

                        <p>For my web typography exercize in my Web Design 3 class, I sought to recreate the layout of my favourite magazine, National Geographic.

                        <h3>User Interface &amp; User Experience</h3>
                        <h4>What are they and how do they differ?</h4>
                        <a class="text-link" href="http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2012/06/ui-vs-ux-whats-the-difference/">Web Designer Depot - UI vs UX: What's the difference?</a>
                        <p>User interface is a fairly literal concept. It refers to the elements in a site that the user interacts with the website by. These can be buttons, sliders, links, input boxes, or anything else that responds to the users input.</p>
                        <p>User experience is a much broader topic however, that encompasses any sort of product that a company can produce for the use of their customers, whether it be the website, the products, or even the service provided by employees. The user experience is the impression made on the customer by their interaction with the company.</p>
                        <p>In terms of web design, this refers to both the styling and the function of the user interface. A user interface can be functional, but have mediocre user experience. It comes down to the ease of use, the clarity of the interface, the polish of the animations, and much more that make customer feel content and satisfied with their experience.</p>
                        <p>The key to such an experience is recognising the effect that shapes and graphics have on the user's emotions. Human perception is tied closely to emotion, so that even something as basic as a rectangle can carry emotional meaning by its aspect, its colour, its size, or the rounding of its corners. Every element, every colour, and every image forms a comprehensive whole that triggers a reflexive emotional response in the brain, and whether a user realizes it or not, they can be made to feel a particular way by subtle arrangements of elements.</p>
