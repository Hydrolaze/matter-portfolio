    <p>My employer, Decorative Services, owns a company called Ego-ID that prints and laser etches metal dog tags for the promotional industry. This company makes frequent appearances at the PPAI expo, so I was asked to design their backdrop and booth table.</p>
    
    <p>The backdrop was fairly straightforward, given that it is a rectangle. I did make some considerations for the height of the people operating the booth though, as the title and critical information would need to be above their heads. Aside from this, the bulk of the design is the company's products. I used 3D warping in Illustrator to give the appearance that all of the tags were facing away from a central point.</p>
    
    <?php single_photo($section_name, false, '2016.jpg', 600, 'centre', 'Here I took advantage of the simplicity of the dog take to make a radiating design.'); ?>

    <p>Aside from the backdrop, I also designed the booth table, which is rounded and has a graphic which wraps all the way around. For the 2015 show I designed a graphic with a ribbon that wrapped around the table. The logo was three dimensional as well, I cut a round piece of styrofoam and printed a logo for the front, and a long strip to cover the sides with.</p>
