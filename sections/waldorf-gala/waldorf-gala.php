    <p>A regular client of Mouse Graphics is the Waldorf School of Orange County. They hold an annual charity gala and auction, and for the 2018 event I was asked to create a design for a flier, web graphic, and vinyl banner. The theme for this event was "Around the World", and the school's representative supplied me with a painted globe image to based my designs around.</p>
    
    <!-- single_photo of a side-by-side comparison of the original image and the globe -->
    
    <span class="caption">The image provided wasn't great quality or resolution, but I was able to correct it in Photoshop.</span>

    <p>To compliment the painterly look of the globe, I decided to go with a felt-textured paper background. To compliment the blues and greens of the globe, I made the background into a light ivory paper by overlaying a sepia color set to multiply blend. I wanted the vibrant colors of the globe to stand out though, so the multiply overlay included a white radial gradient around the globe so that it was bordered with pure white.</p>

    <p>To drive the theme home, I placed the title text ("Around the World") over the globe and created a white glow around the text to ensure legibility. The text in the design was also colored with dominant colors from the globe in order to create unity. </p>

    <p>I began with the flier design since it was the most normally sized piece in the project. Once it was approved however, I began adapting it into the banner and web graphic. Both of these designs had their own challenges that I needed to overcome.</p>
    
    <p>The web banner was landscape-oriented to fit at the top of a webpage, so I needed to adjust the layout accordingly. The header graphic moved to the left, and the mission statement filled up the remaining space on the right side. I was also careful to save any designs for this web graphic in the correct RGB color space so that the colors could be as vibrant as possible.</p>

    <span class="caption">The client didn't care for the curly brackets I placed around the mission statement, so I knocked it out of a color block instead so that it still held visual weight.</span>
    
    <p>The globe painting that I was provided with was not a high enough resolution to use on the large 34" &times; 40" banner. I informed the client of this as soon as I received the graphic, but she was not able to get in touch with the original artist to acquire a high resolution scan before I began the banner design. Instead of compromising the design I had already created by scaling the globe down, I came up with a workaround.</p>
    
    <p>I realized that since the globe already had a painted appearance, I could increase the detail in it by applying a brushstroke filter in Photoshop. Now instead of blurry pixels, people viewing the banner up close would see fine brushstrokes in the globe. The globe was linked into my other two design files as well, so the new filtered globe painting was conveniently relinked automatically into the flier and web banner.</p>

    <p>The client was very pleased with this approach, and after a few more copy revisions, the three designs were approved and sent to press well before the date of the gala.</p>
