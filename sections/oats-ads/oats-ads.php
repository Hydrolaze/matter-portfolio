    <h2>My first large-format public advertisement</h2>
    </header>
    <div class="copy">
       <?php single_photo($section_name, false, 'ad-in-situ.jpg', 320, 'right', 'I was elated to see my work on public display in the mall.'); ?>
       
        <p>While I worked as a designer at Mouse Graphics, a respresentative from a local optometry practice reached out to have their branding redone and an ad created. This was very exciting, as the ad would be mounted in a backlit directory display, and would therefore be viewed by the thousands of people that frequent The Shops at Mission Viejo. I was provided with their existing logo and a rough mockup of the ad design they wanted. My first task was to update the logo, adding eyelids and eyelashes to frame the eye into a more recognizable form.</p>
        
        <?php single_photo($section_name, false, 'oats-ad-client-mockup.jpg', 240, 'left', 'The initial mockup that the client provided, which informed my stylistic choices.'); ?>

        <p>I tried out many variations of the eyelids and eyelashes, trying to strike a balance between them and the existing iris logo. Once we found a good composition, I also created a subtle gradation of line weights down the iris to create a fade effect.</p>
        
        <p>One reason for the creation of the new logo was that it would be used in an updated website that the firm was having created. While working on the logo however, I realized that viewing lines in the iris at the lower resolutions and sizes that would be necessary on the web caused a moir√© pattern. To rectify this, I created a simplified version of the logo using half the lines at double the thickness. I packaged both logo versions in both vector and raster formats into a ZIP file for their web designer to use.</p>

        <?php photogrid($section_name, 'logo-versions', 3, 3, 'center'); ?>

        <p>Once the final logo was selected, I began work on the ad. Going off of the assumption that the mockup reflected their design preferences, I chose dominant colors of cyan and smoky, translucent black, with crysanthemum yellow as an accent.</p>
        
        <p>The main font in the mockup was a serif font, and although I wanted to emulate this, I felt that it would clash with the modern look of the logo. I settled on Superclarendon, a slab serif font whose rounded shapes would pair perfectly with the circle-based forms of the logo. As a body font I selected Colaborate [sic], a  fairly standard and readable sans-serif font. It stood out to me because of the "t" which kicks out at the bottom, giving the typeface a unique feeling that paired well with Superclarendon.</p>
        
        <?php single_photo($section_name, false, 'oats-ad-design-process.jpg', 720, 'centre', 'From the rough mockup that client created, I selected a few fonts and colors that would work harmoniously while conveying the appearance they wanted.'); ?>
        
        <p>After squaring away the brand elements, I began creating a rough draft of the ad. Faint, enlarged versions of the striped iris of the logo hung behind translucent bars of grey, where I placed text and graphics. I placed the directional text at eye-height, where it would tell people clearly that the practice was straight ahead.</p>
        
        <?php single_photo($section_name, false, 'oats-ad-proof-v2.png', 320, 'right', 'With the alternate photo of Dr. Ciobanu, my second draft was much more balanced and appealing.'); ?>
        
        <p>I felt that the key to this ad was a solid, eye-catching photo of Dr. Ciobanu, the main optometrist at the practice. The photo I was initially provided with was posed awkwardly, with the edges of her shoulders cropped off. I requested more options and was rewarded with an excellent photo, in which the Doctor's entire upper body was visible in a relaxed, friendly pose. Using Photoshop, I masked out the background, allowing me to place the Doctor at a large size in the center of the ad, with her phoropter extending off the edge. I also performed a hue adjustment on the phoropter to correct a yellowish cast that was clashing with the turquoise in the ad.</p>
        
        <?php single_photo($section_name, false, 'oats-holiday-ad.jpg', 320, 'left', 'I saved time designing this by reusing snowflakes that I had created for another design project.'); ?>
        
        <p>After the completion of this ad, the client has come back to me multiple times with updates and modifications to the ad. One of my favorites was a holiday-themed version that we printed on Sintra to fit into a valet sign stand. I adapted the striped irises into baubles that would give viewers a clear association with the holiday season and the impending expiration of their vision benefits.</p>
