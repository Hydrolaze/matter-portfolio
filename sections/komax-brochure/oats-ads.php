    <h2>Challenging typesetting projects from an industrial manufacturer.</h2>
    </header>
    <div class="copy">
        <p>My job at Mouse Graphics put my InDesign skills to the test on many occasions. One such occasion was a project that I worked on for Komax Systems, a company that manufactures industrial fluid mixing units. They have been around for some time, and as a result many of their brochures were outdated, made back in a time before the ease and power of Adobe software.</p>

        <!-- single_photo of an old Komax brochure spread -->
        
        <span class="caption">The 70s/80s styling of the brochure was refreshing to work with.</span>

        <p>Komax was not yet ready to commit to a full redesign of their advertising materials, so my task was to simply recreate the old brochures in a modern format. I was given all the diagrams and art assets that they could locate, and told to recreate any assets that were missing or too-low resolution to use.</p>
        
        <p>One reason for the creation of the new logo was that it would be used in an updated website that the firm was having created. While working on the logo however, I realized that viewing lines in the iris at the lower resolutions and sizes that would be necessary on the web caused a moir√© pattern. To rectify this, I created a simplified version of the logo using half the lines at double the thickness. I packaged both logo versions in both vector and raster formats into a ZIP file for their web designer to use.</p>

        <?php photogrid($section_name, 'logo-versions', 3, 3, 'center'); ?>

        <p>Once the final logo was selected, I began work on the ad. Going off of the assumption that the mockup reflected their design preferences, I chose dominant colors of cyan and smoky black, with crysanthemum yellow as an accent.</p>
        
        <p>The main font in the mockup was a serif font, and although I wanted to emulate this, I felt that it would clash with the modern look of the logo. I settled on Superclarendon, a slab serif font whose rounded shapes would pair perfectly with the circle-based forms of the logo. As a body font I selected Colaborate [sic], a  fairly standard and readable sans-serif font. It stood out to me because of the "t" which kicks out at the bottom, giving the typeface a unique feeling that paired well with Superclarendon.</p>
        
        <p>After squaring away the brand elements, I began creating a rough draft of the ad. Faint, enlarged versions of the striped iris of the logo hung behind translucent bars of grey, where I placed text and graphics. I placed the directional text at eye-height, where it would tell people clearly that the practice was straight ahead.</p>
        
        <?php single_photo($section_name, false, 'oats-ad-design-process.jpg', 720, 'centre', 'From the rough mockup that client created, I selected a few fonts and colors that would work harmoniously while conveying the appearance they wanted.'); ?>
        
        <p>I felt that the key to this ad was a solid, eye-catching photo of Dr. Ciobanu, the main optometrist at the practice. The photo I was initially provided with was posed awkwardly, with the edges of her shoulders cropped off. I requested more options and was rewarded with an excellent photo, in which the Doctor's entire upper body was visible in a relaxed, friendly pose. Using Photoshop, I masked out the background, allowing me to place the Doctor at a large size in the center of the ad, with her phoropter extending off the edge. I also performed a hue adjustment on the phoropter to correct a yellowish cast that was clashing with the turquoise in the ad.</p>
        
        <?php single_photo($section_name, false, 'oats-ad-proof-v2.png', 320, 'centre', 'With the alternate photo of Dr. Ciobanu, my second draft was much more balanced and appealing.'); ?>
        
        <p>After the completion of this ad, the client has come back to me multiple times with updates and modifications to the ad. One of my favorites was a holiday-themed version that we printed on Sintra to fit into a valet sign stand. I adapted the striped irises into baubles that would give viewers a clear association with the holiday season and the impending expiration of their vision benefits.</p>
        
        <?php single_photo($section_name, false, 'oats-holiday-ad.jpg', 320, 'centre', 'I saved time designing this by reusing snowflakes that I had created for another design project.'); ?>
