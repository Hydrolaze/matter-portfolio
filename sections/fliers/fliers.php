    <p>Design is not something I picked up recently in college; I have been design-minded my whole life, and I taught myself to use Macromedia software in middle school. This article shows off some of the pieces I created before I graduated high school.</p>

        <h4>Yearbook Advertisement</h4>

        <p>Yearbook was a natural choice of extracurricular activity for me; I got the chance to practice photography and layouts, as well as contribute to something that would be enjoyed by the entire school. I was asked to make a flier to announce preorders for yearbooks, so I created something interesting and relatable that featured a current "internet meme".</p>

        <h4>Concert Flier</h4>

        <p>I am a musician at heart, and in high school I played the cello in orchestra. We were a part of a "mega concert" with choir and drumline, and I had the honor of being asked to design the flier. I was perhaps a bit biased in favor of the orchestra when I used a violin to represent the event, but it communicated the concept of music effectively.</p>

        <h4>Graduation Invitation</h4>

        <p>When my high school graduation came along, I was excited to mark the occasion by designing my own invitation. I retouched a photo that my mom took of me, adjusting to compensate for lighting, and I created a simple layout based on the school's color, which is teal.</p>
        
        <p>I also created the school's logo, which is featured in the top left of the invitation. Unfortunately, my files were stored on a hard drive that I've since lost track of, but the logo can still be <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@33.2307919,-117.2490896,3a,75y,246.72h,74.35t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s1SST1Qi5wnwhex4jRTf0oQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1">seen on the school's sign</a>.</p>

        <h4>Eagle Scout project</h4>

        <p>I earned the BSA's Eagle Scout award in July 2012. My project involved collecting used liquid storage barrels from a local Coca Cola plant and redistributing them to residents of the city of Vista for use as emergency water storage. Along with the barrels, we handed out instructional decals to help people maintain a drinkable water supply. I enjoyed making the label as attractive as it was useful.</p>

        <h4>Social Event Flier</h4>

        <p>The members of my parents' church are very social and frequently gather for potlucks and other events. Word got out that I had design talent, and I was asked to create a flyer for a Christmas event. I kept the design simple to conserve color ink, and used festive embroidery embellishments to make the purpose of the event apparent.</p>
