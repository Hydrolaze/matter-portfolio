PanseyBoy:This is a great feature. What kind of things can we message about?!
Beb:Da beb hai
Other Beb:Oh hai, beb!
Aaron:Whoops! I was trying to style my own textarea, but there was one in Materialize.css after all!
Aaron on Mobile:Testing the messageboard on mobile; everything looks good!
Aaron:Testing to see whether the form fields are correctly cleared after the post is submitted.
Aaron:That didn't work; how about now?
Aaron:Okay I think it was a caching issue. Now does it work?!
MeaI:;)
Aaron:Attempted to add a SPICY text animation.
Aaron:Forgot some quotation marks lmao. Does it work now?
Aaron:Forgot even MORE quotation marks.
Aaron:Nvm, I realised it wasn't possible due to the fact that text colour can't be animated.
Non:Oh hey MeaI
